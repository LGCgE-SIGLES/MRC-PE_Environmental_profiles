# General limitations of the dataset and precautions for indicator use

Open environmental data were mobilized to spatially characterize, in a homogeneous manner across metropolitan France, environmental determinants potentially associated with health inequalities. The constructed indicators describe the physical environment, understood as the outdoor living environment of populations. They cover a broad range of environmental characteristics, including factors that may be detrimental to health as well as factors that may be beneficial.

These indicators constitute a relevant basis for spatial analyses conducted at the municipal level across metropolitan France. However, their use requires careful consideration of several general limitations and precautions, which are discussed transversally below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Territorial context indicators

A key point is that the indicators describe average environmental conditions at the territorial scale (municipal spatial unit). They should therefore be interpreted as proxies of potential exposure or environmental pressure. As such, they are useful for comparing territorial contexts with one another, but they remain largely insufficient for directly inferring individual-level exposures or health risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Temporal heterogeneity of indicators

The mobilized open data sources exhibit temporal mismatches in both periods of availability and temporal resolution. Some sources are available over long time spans, with annual temporal resolution (e.g., agricultural land use, purchases of pesticide active substances) or daily resolution (e.g., air pollution). In these cases, the indicators constructed for this dataset were temporally aggregated and correspond to averages calculated over the full period of data availability.

In contrast, other data sources are available only for a single reference year and therefore represent a snapshot of environmental conditions at a specific point in time (e.g., contaminated sites and soils, road network, naturalness index).

## Thematic-specific points of attention

Finally, each thematic domain is subject to specific limitations related to the characteristics of the open data sources used and to the methodological choices made during indicator construction. These theme-specific considerations are documented in the dedicated README files within each corresponding directory.
