# General limitations of the dataset and precautions for indicator use

Open environmental data were mobilized to spatially characterize, in a homogeneous manner across metropolitan France, environmental determinants potentially associated with health inequalities. The constructed indicators describe the physical environment, understood as the outdoor living environment of populations. They cover a broad range of environmental characteristics, including factors that may be detrimental to health as well as factors that may be beneficial.

These indicators constitute a relevant basis for spatial analyses conducted in metropolitan France at the municipal level. However, their use requires careful consideration of a number of general limitations and usage precautions, which are discussed transversally below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Territorial context indicators

A central point is that the indicators describe average environmental conditions at the scale of a territory (municipal spatial unit). They should therefore be understood as proxies of potential exposure or environmental pressure. As such, they are useful for comparing territorial contexts with one another, but they are largely insufficient to directly infer individual-level exposures or risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Temporal heterogeneity of indicators

The open data sources mobilized exhibit temporal mismatches, both in terms of periods of availability and temporal resolution. Some data sources were available over long periods, with annual temporal resolution (e.g. agricultural land use, purchases of pesticide active substances) or daily resolution (e.g. air pollution). In these cases, the indicators constructed for this dataset were temporally aggregated and correspond to averages computed over the full period of data availability.

In other cases, data sources were only available for a single reference year and therefore reflect a snapshot of environmental conditions at a given point in time (e.g. contaminated sites and soils, road network, naturalness index).

## Thematic-specific points of attention

Finally, each thematic domain is subject to specific limitations related to the characteristics of the open data sources used and to the methodological choices made during indicator construction. These thematic-specific points of attention are documented in the dedicated README files within each corresponding directory.
